with numpy
1. x is the input of the function, y is the output of the function
2.axis = 0 as rows(from top to bottom), axis = 1 as columns(from left to right)
with type signatures

-------

Derivatives
1. the rate of change of the output of the function with respect to its input
d f =          f a + Δ − f a − Δ
du a  lim Δ 0        2 × Δ


-------

Nested function --> Composite function

nested function:
f2(f1(x)) = y
both need to be differentiable
