George Brown College is a public and fully accedited college of applied arts
and technology located in Toronto, Ontario. GBC boasts 3 campuses downtown and
over 170 full time programs.

GBC courses range from post-grad, diploma, and advanced diploma studies.
Most GBC courses are in arts and technologies, but they have additional
programs in a variety of disciplines, such as social work, culinary arts,
and health sciences.

George Brown has 3 major campuses. The program I'm taking, T141, is delivered
through their Casa Loma Campus near Dupont station. Their other campuses are
located at St. James on King East, and their Waterfront campus is near
Queen's Quay between Jarvis and Parliament.

Surprisingly, George Brown College has a number of famous and unexpected
alumni: Lynn Crawford, a popular Food Network chef; Gigi Gorgeous, a trans
Youtuber who gained popularity while I was in high school; and Samantha Bee,
a comedian who began her career with The Daily Show.
