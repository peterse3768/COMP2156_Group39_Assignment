The role of DevOps engineering holds a great importance in the eficiency and
quality control of software development, IT, and other projects. From what I 
have learned, DevOps engineering can be likened to the "brain" of project
development. In the human body, our organs and systems are all vital to
survival but they cannot work unless we have our brain and nervous system
controlling and automating them. In software development, a team needs
programmers, UI designers, accountants, and many other roles, and the DevOps
engineer serves to have all these diferent roles work together to produce
software and projects efficiently and to standard. 

DevOps allows the fields of IT and software development to grow and evolve at
high rate giving thanks to the use of continuous integration, delivery and
deployment, and with greater quality control. DevOps also reduces the
likelihood of interferences between team members of a project as the
application of version control methods, such as GitHub, allow for multiple
branches, forks, and versions of a build with the ability to revert to other
versions and debug and revise efficiently.

In conclusion, DevOps has made an essential role for itself in IT and
software development, and will inevitably be important to learn in a vast
number of industries. As someone hopeful of entering the IT/cyber security
fields, I'm thankful that I'm learning about DevOps practices and the
assistance they'll give me in developing my career.
