What is a DevOps engineer?

Simply put, it's a person specializing in the methodology of software
development and IT, working to automate and make more eficient the
development and operations of projects. If you look further however, the
set of skills a DevOps engineer must posess are vast and constantly changing
as the fields grow and evolve.

The course we're taking, COMP2156, intends to equip students with the
foundations of a proficient DevOps engineer. Throughout the course, students
will learn about:
	- Github, Git, and repository management
	- data types and markup languages (XML, JSON, YML, YAML, YANG, etc)
	- Continuous integration/delivery/deployment (CI/CD); Travis, etc.
	- collaboration practices for efficient version control
	- database and cloud computing
	- enforcnig code quality and standards through DevOps pipelines
	- security practices in software development cycles
and much more!

By the end of the course, students should have a foundational knowledge of
DevOps practices and workplaces. I hope to continue to hone the skills I'm
learning even after my time at George Brown College!
